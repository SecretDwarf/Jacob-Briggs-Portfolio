# Overview
This is my personal portfolio that I created using React. The base was built using npm create react app.

## How to start a test server on your computer
This site will soon be hosted online but for now, you can pull the code. After you have React JS downloaded and running you can use terminal and npm install to install the necessary packages and then use npm start to run the code.

## Demo

Here is a short demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.
[Coming Soon](http://youtube.link.goes.here)

# Web Pages

Landing page: the landing page is the first view on the site and introduces the 8-bit and pixel theme that I've gone with. It features a typescript animation to list some of my skills and hobbies as well as links to the other pages. Its animated background also tracks the cursor to make a waterfall effect with raining pixels as a backdrop. 

Resume Page: The resume page utilizes an embedded Google doc so as I update my resume It is automatically updated in my portfolio. The resume page has an animated background set up as a grid and creates randomly colored blocks as the cursor passes over each square in the grid.

Contact Page: The contact page uses email JS to route the information from the contact form to my email. Feel free to try it out if you have any questions.

# Development Environment

I built my portfolio using React JS. I use VS Code as my main IDE and plan to host this webpage in the near future. I started the project with create-react-app and I used Email JS to connect my contact page to my email. I'm also using the react-router-dom and react-typescript-animation, which I installed using npm.
